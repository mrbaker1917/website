For each term, you will need to provide an   approximate date or dates (one point each) and historical significance (two   points each; usually 2-3 complete sentences).</p></td>

      <p>In this section, there will be questions about the documents assigned on the course website (pre-midterm exam). Students will be provided with a fairly obvious quotation from a document, and then have to identify it by providing (1) the author, (2) the approximate date of its origin (as accurately as you can), and (3) then explain its <strong>historical significance</strong>. I will provide a <a href="Hist215midtermdocs.html">short list of the documents</a> to study for this section of the exam</a>. Each question will be worth four points: one point for the author's name; one point for the date; and two points for a correct explanation of the document's <strong>historical significance</strong>.</p></td>

      <p align="left">For   the essay question, you will have a choice of ONE out of TWO. It is crucial that   you first of all state the question, then your thesis statement (your answer to   the question). Then, make an argument for your thesis, and finally   conclude.  It is not sufficient to   describe the events.  You must make an   argument in response to the question. Below are sample questions that may or may   not appear on the exam.</p></td>
