  <h2 align="center">Very Important RULES</h2>  
 <hr />
        <ul>
        <li>Make-up examinations will be permitted only with written verification of medical or personal emergencies. I require written evidence.</li>
        <li>Each student should read Koc University's Student Code of Conduct, especially concerning Academic Dishonesty. Using words from any source without placing them in quotation marks and citing the source is plagiarism. Submitting a paper (in whole or part) that was submitted for any other course is also plagiarism. Submitting someone else's work as your own is plagiarism. Looking at another student's exam or using any outside sources during an examination is cheating. A course grade of "F" will be applied in all proven instances of cheating and plagiarism.</li>
        <li>You MUST check your email account on a regular basis in order to do well in this course. I frequently send email messages about upcoming events concerning the course, as well as handouts and other course materials. If you are not in the habit of checking your Koc email regularly, you will need to start or have your email forwarded to whatever email address you do use regularly.</li>
        <li>Be on time for class: if you need to leave class early, please let me know in advance. I will close the classroom door as soon as I am ready to lecture. Students who come late, may ask to enter, but they will be marked absent for that class period, unless they can provide a documented reason for their absence.</li>
        <li>The classroom is a public forum for dialogue. Hence, all electronic communication devices (especially cell phones and pagers) must be turned off during class.</li>
        <li>Students unable to comply with any of these guidelines should see me personally and immediately to discuss their reasons.</li>        
        </ul>
