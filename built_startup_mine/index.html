            <h3 class="title" id="about">About me:</h3>
            <p>I am from Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. I grew up playing hockey, soccer, and basketball (in that order). I also went to school, worked hard, did well, and managed somehow to get into Harvard University, where I completed a Ph.D. in 2001. Since then, I have taught at four universities: one year at L'viv National University in Ukraine; seven years at California State University, Bakersfield; eight more years at Koc University, Istanbul, Turkey; and most recently at the University of Victoria (just one course as a sessional instructor, but on the history of rock and roll). Though I was trained as a historian and worked in history departments throughout my career, I have always been focused on teaching students how to write. I have spent much of my time editing my students' and  colleagues' writings, helping them to improve. Gradually, this became my main focus. I have developed extensive skills to help writers to write better. If you are passionate about your ideas, I can help you to put them into clear, concise, engaging prose. So, feel free to send me some of your writing, and I will let you know how I can help you.</p>
            <p>One other thing: I am not at all narrowly focused on editing academic writing or student papers. I am open to helping with any kind of writing: fiction, fact, historical fiction, fantasy, science fiction, a grant proposal, a website, a tweet, whatever you are writing about, for whatever reason.</p>
