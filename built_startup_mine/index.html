            <h3 class="title" id="about">About me</h3>
            <p>I am from Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. I grew up playing hockey, soccer, and basketball (in that order). I also went to school, worked hard, did well, and managed somehow to get into Harvard University, where I completed a Ph.D. in 2001. Since then, I have taught at four universities: one year at L'viv National University in Ukraine; seven years at California State University, Bakersfield; eight more years at Koc University, Istanbul, Turkey; and most recently at the University of Victoria (just one course as a sessional instructor, but on the history of rock and roll). Though I was trained as a historian and worked in history departments throughout my career, I have always been focused on teaching students how to write. I have spent much of my time editing my students' and  colleagues' writings, helping them to improve. Gradually, this became my main focus. I have developed extensive skills to help writers to write better. If you are passionate about your ideas, I can help you to put them into clear, concise, engaging prose. So, feel free to send me some of your writing, and I will let you know how I can help you.</p>
            <p>One other thing: I am not at all narrowly focused on editing academic writing or student papers. I am open to helping with any kind of writing: fiction, fact, historical fiction, fantasy, science fiction, a grant proposal, a website, a tweet, whatever you are writing about, for whatever reason.</p>

            <h3 class="title">My Services</h3>
            <p>I can help writers in a number of ways. Below are the most useful ones:</p>
            <hr>
            
            <ul class="grid">
                <li>
                    <i class="fa fa-edit fa-4x"></i>
                    <h4>Writing Coach</h4>
                    <p>This is a broadly defined job: basically, a writer sends me some of her or his writing, and I provide extensive comments on it, not only concerning grammar and style, but also structure, coherence, logic, appeal, etc. For this service, I usually charge $12 per page (250 words), though price is negotiable.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i class="fa fa-edit fa-4x"></i>
                    <h4>Editor</h4>
                    <p>This is a simpler version of the writing coach. Usually, the writer will send me an essentially completed text, and I will make it conform to a specific style manual of a publishing house or publication, correct grammar and punctuation, and help make the prose clear, concise, and readable. For this service, I usually change $10 per page (250 words), though price is negotiable, depending on the quality of the prose submitted.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i class="fa fa-tachometer fa-4x"></i>
                    <h4>Proofreader</h4>
                    <p>This is a lite version of editing, checking to make sure there are no grammar or puncation problems, typos or spelling errors.  For this service, I charge $8 per page (250 words). Price is negotiable, depending on how much work is required to create a clean error-free text.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i class="fa fa-globe fa-4x"></i>
                    <h4>Translator</h4>
                    <p>I have extensive experience translating Russian and Ukrainian into English. I am also capable of translating German and French. I will also ensure the translation is rendered into readable, error-free English prose and make sure there are no grammar or punctuation errors. For this service, I charge $20 per page (250 words), though price is negotiable.</p>
