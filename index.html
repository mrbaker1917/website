        <h3 class="title" id="about">About me</h3>
        <p>I am from Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. I grew up playing hockey, soccer, and basketball (in that order). I also
            went to school, worked hard, did well, and managed somehow to get into Harvard University, where I completed
            a Ph.D. in 2001. Since then, I have taught at four universities: one year at L'viv National University in
            Ukraine; seven years at California State University, Bakersfield; eight more years at Koc University,
            Istanbul, Turkey; and more recently at the University of Victoria (just one course, as a sessional
            instructor, on the history of rock and roll).</p>
        <p>Recently, I decided to change my career path. I have been learning Data Science over the last year, and in July 2022, I
            successfully completed the Data Analyst Certification at <a href="https://www.datacamp.com" target="_blank" 
            style="color: navy;">datacamp</a>.
            As a result, I am currently looking for work as a data analyst. I am adept at Python, SQL, and many associated libraries
            used for extracting, manipulating, displaying, and modelling data. In addition, from August to November 2020 I completed
            the <a href="https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/en/web-development-bootcamp" target="_blank"
                style="color: navy;">Lighthouse Labs Web Development BootCamp</a>.
            I am proficient in Python, SQL, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SASS, Ruby, Rails, Node, and React;
            I also learned test-driven development, focusing on these testing packages: Mocha, Chai, JEST, Cypress, Storybook, and rspec.
            I am open to any kind of coding work, and I love learning, so I am eager to learn other languages and frameworks.
