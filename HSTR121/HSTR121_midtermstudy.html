Essential Terms (30 points; three points each; choice of 10/25): </strong>These are the terms (people, concepts, events, ideas) that it is essential to know for the Midterm Examination. Not all of them will be on the examination, but knowing the importance of all these terms in the context of our course will help you greatly in the examination overall; short answer and essay questions. Students will answer 10 terms from a choice of 25. For each term, students will provide a date (one point), explain what the term is (one point), and explain the term's historical significance within the context of our course on the history of Rock and Roll (two points).</p></td>

It is crucial that students, first of all, indicate which question they are answering, then state the thesis  (answer to the question); then, make an argument for that thesis, and finally conclude. It is not sufficient to describe the events. Students must make an argument in response to the question using the readings and lecture material to support their answers.

"Whether those ten or 15 numbers sound roughly the same. You don't care what period they were written in, what they're all about. It's the bloody explosion that they create when you let the gun off. It's the event. That's what rock and roll is." Do you agree or disagree with this quotation?
