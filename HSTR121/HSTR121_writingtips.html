						<p align="left"><strong>Past tense</strong>: History is usually written in the past tense, mostly in the past perfect tense: &quot;The peasants plundered.&quot; &quot;The politicians debated.&quot; But when one writes about what a historian has written, write this in the present tense: &quot;Sanders states that female murderers killed for revenge.&quot;</p>

						<div align="left">
							<p><strong>Passive versus Active Voice: </strong>Avoid writing in the passive voice. Always strive to write in the active voice, because this makes clear the connection between the historical actors and the actions. Here are some basic rules:</p>
							<ol>
								<li>
									<p>The subject of each sentence should do something; so do not write: &quot;The Acropolis was attacked by the masses of Athenians.&quot; Instead, make the subject, that is &quot;the masses,&quot; active: &quot;The masses of Athens attacked the Acropolis.&quot;</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>In general, avoid all forms of the verb &quot;to be&quot; [i.e. was, is, were, and especially <strong>being</strong>] whenever possible. Sometimes you need them, but be sure that you do.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>Avoid the prepositional phrase &quot;by + subject&quot; (as in the example above &quot;by the masses&quot;).</p>
								</li>
							</ol>
						</div>

				<tr bgcolor="#f6f3e2">
					<td colspan="3">
						<div align="left">
							<p><strong>Introduction and Conclusion:</strong> Your introduction and conclusion should be clear and to the point. Make sure that you tell the reader exactly what you are arguing and how you will go about it.</p>
							<p><strong>Thesis</strong>: Your introduction and conclusion should contain your thesis statement, stated as strongly as you can (considering the evidence you have to support it). In the introduction you should also briefly list the points you will make to prove your thesis.</p>
							<p><strong>Organization of paragraphs</strong>: Each paragraph should begin with a topic sentence that tells the reader what the paragraph is about. Each paragraph should contain only ONE main idea; the evidence and examples included should support and prove this idea. A paragraph should be no less than three sentences (in most cases). A single sentence does not a paragraph make. Do not worry if some of your paragraphs are more than a page in length, as long as the words in each focus on and help to prove one main point.</p>

							<p><strong>The Apostrophe:</strong></p>
							<p>Use the apostrophe to indicate possession, but NOT to indicate plural:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Correct: &quot;Karl Marx's fantastic ideas about class struggle provoked mayhem.&quot;</li>
								<li>Incorrect: &quot;Some worker's decided that Marx was right.&quot;</li>
							</ul>
							<p>Apostrophes are required in contractions, such as &quot;don't&quot; or &quot;I've.&quot; But since contractions are not acceptable in scholarly writing, you will not have to use the apostrophe in this way.</p>
							<p>&quot;It's&quot; versus &quot;Its&quot;: &quot;It's&quot; is a contraction of it is. Do NOT use it, because it is a contraction. &quot;Its&quot; is the possessive pronoun of &quot;it&quot; and does not require an apostrophe.</p>

				<tr bgcolor="#f6f3e2">
					<td colspan="3">
						<p align="left"><strong>Personal Pronouns:</strong> The second-person pronoun YOU is too informal for use in scholarly writing. Please write mainly in the third person (she, he, they, it, her, him, them). You may occasionally &quot;I,&quot; as in &quot;I think&quot; or &quot;I argue.&quot; Do not use &quot;I feel&quot; or &quot;I believe.&quot;</p>

							<p align="left"><strong>Avoid Slang</strong>: Avoid using slang words or phrases. For example, &quot;Voltaire told Rousseau to chill.&quot; &quot;Chill&quot; is a slang expression and should not be used in formal writing.</p>

							<p><strong>Here are some other tips to improve your term paper:</strong></p>
							<ul>
								<li>Avoid beginning a sentence with &quot;and,&quot; &quot;but,&quot; or &quot;also.&quot;</li>
								<li>Place quotation marks OUTSIDE of periods or commas, and INSIDE of colons or semi-colons.</li>
								<li>Place foot- or endnote numbers OUTSIDE or AFTER the period or comma, and superscript if possible. If only parenthetical references are required, place them after the last word of the sentence but BEFORE the period; for example, (McKay, p. 234).</li>
								<li>Do not use &quot;dropped quotations.&quot; In other words, always introduce the quotation with a sentence (followed by a colon) or by a phrase (followed by a comma) that lets your reader know why the quotation is being introduced.</li>
								<li>Place a hyphen between two adjectives modifying each other AND followed by a noun (e.g., &quot;a two-front war,&quot; &quot;middle-class values,&quot; &quot;well-known commander,&quot; BUT &quot;he was well known.&quot;</li>
								<li>Never use a semi-colon before &quot;and.&quot; It is grammatically incorrect.</li>
								<li>Use inclusive language (e.g., use &quot;humanity&quot; instead of &quot;man&quot;).</li>
								<li>Use a comma before &quot;and&quot; when a new subject follows the &quot;and.&quot;</li>
								<li>Write out numbers up to 100 (e.g., twenty-seven, but 107).</li>
								<li>Avoid the &quot;would&quot; construction for activities that clearly happened in the past. For example, don't write that &quot;chemical weapons would be unleashed in 1915.&quot; They WERE, and that is that. Use the past tense then to discuss events that happened in the past.</li>
								<li>Countries are not &quot;she&quot; Use &quot;it&quot; or &quot;they&quot; to refer to countries and nations.</li>
								<li>There is no apostrophe before the &quot;s&quot; when noting years (e.g., the 1900s).</li>
								<li>Remember to use transitional expressions (such as yet, nor, however, nevertheless, moreover,therefore,indeed, for example) to help move your reader from one sentence and point to another. Remember that words such as however, moreover, and therefore, when used between two separate sentences, must follow a period or a semi-colon, not a comma. A comma in this case would create a comma splice.</li>
								<li>Make sure each of your sentences is a complete thought and complete sentence grammatically.</li>
