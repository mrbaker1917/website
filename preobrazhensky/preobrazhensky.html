          <h3>Preobrazhensky was arguably the most consistent of Bolshevik-Marxists, always advocating world revolution over the trappings of state power. Peruse this brief timeline and learn a little about him:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>1886: </strong>Yevegeni was born in Bolkhov, Oryol Province. His father was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zemstvo" target="_blank">zemstvo</a> teacher and son of an Orthodox priest.</li>
            <li><strong>1900: </strong>At the age of 14, Yevgeni abandoned his belief in god, probably resulting from his intensive reading in rationalist and socialist philosophical ideas.</li>
            <li><strong>1903: </strong>Preobrazhensky declared his formal allegiance to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Social_Democratic_Labour_Party" target="_blank">Russian Social Democratic Workers' Party (RSDRP)</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>October 1905: </strong>During the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1905_Russian_Revolution" target="_blank">1905 Russian Revolution</a>, Preobrazhensky traveled to Moscow, where the Moscow branch of the RSDRP appointed him chief propagandist of the city's Presnenskii raion (district).</li>
            <li><strong>1909: </strong>Travelling about the vast empire, hiding from the Tsarist police, he found himself in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irkutsk" target="_blank">Irkutsk</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>March 1917: </strong>Elected as a deputy to the Chita Soviet of Workers' Deputies.</li>
            <li><strong>July 1917: </strong>At the Sixth Congress of the RSDRP(Bolshevik) he was elected as a candidate member (alternate) to the party's Central Committee.</li>
            <li><strong>January 1918: </strong>Preobrazhensky moved to the Urals to lead Bolshevik party organization.</li>
            <li><strong>March 1918: </strong>Shocked by the party leadership's decision to sign the Brest-Litovsk Treaty with the Central Powers, Preobrazhensky joined the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_communism#Russian_left_communism" target="_blank">Left Communists faction</a>, which advocated turning the world war into a world revolution. At this time, he met then Left Communist Nikolai Bukharin.</li>
            <li><strong>1919: </strong>He co-wrote with Nikolai Bukharin the soon to be famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_ABC_of_Communism" target="_blank"><em>ABCs of Communism</em></a> (published first in 1920).</li>
            <li><strong>March 1920: </strong>At the Ninth Party Congress, he was elected a full member of the Bolshevik Party's Central Committee.</li>
            <li><strong>1919-1920</strong>Preobrazhensky appears to have suggested at one of the party congresses that the party should consider dissolving, either because the party had become the state or because the prospect of world revolution had been missed.</li>
            <li><strong>1924-1925: </strong>Having fallen out with Bukharin, the leading advocate of the New Economic Policy (NEP), Preobrazhensky published a series of articles advocating rapid industrialization and price controls to keep rich peasants from swamping the economy and to fund industrial growth. In this, he sided with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Trotsky" target="_blank">Leon Trotsky</a> in the power struggle with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin" target="_blank">Josef Stalin</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>1927: </strong>As a leading member of the United Opposition, Preobrazhensky was repeatedly criticized and eventually in October expelled from the party.</li>
            <li><strong>1929: </strong> Preobrazhensky co-wrote and signed a letter declaring his "ideological and organizational break with Trotskyism".</li>
            <li><strong>1930: </strong>His party membership was restored and he soon became acting head of the People's Commissariat of State Farms.</li>
            <li><strong>1933: </strong>Preobrazhensky was arrested, expelled from the party, and accused of conspiring to form an underground Trotskyist group. He was sentenced to three-years exile in Kazakhstan.</li>
            <li><strong>December 1936: </strong>Preobrazhensky was again arrested. In July 1937 he was convicted of leading a "Youth Trotsyist Center" and convicted "for participation in a revolutionary terrorist organization," to execution. He was shot dead the same day.</li>
            <li><strong>December 1988: </strong>Preobrazhensky was post-humously rehabilited as a victim of Stalin's purges.</li>
